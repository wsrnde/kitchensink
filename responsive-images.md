## srcset Usage 
The browser has no knowlege about the dimensions of an image before it downloaded it from its source.

The srcset attribute offers the browser a list of images and also tells it what width each one image will have.

Depending on the current screen width and the DPR (device pixel ratio), the browser will pick one of theses images and download it. If the screen size is later changed, it will reconsider its decision. ba

### DPR
The Device Pixel Ratio is a measure of how many pixels a screen will fit into a CSS pixel (in one direction). The exact number depends on the screen:

* many desktop devices have a DPR of 1, 
* apple iMacs a device ratio of 2, and 
* the majority of mobile devices have a DPR of 2 or higher (google nexus has a DPR of 3.5).

### Example:
This image has no default (src is empty). The browser will pick one of four images provides depending on the current screen width and the DRP of the device

```
<img 
     src=""
     srcset="uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/1200x576.png 1200w,
             uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/992x576.png   992w,
             uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/768x576.png   768w,
             uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/576x576.png   576w"
     alt="srcset Test"

| Device | Thinkpad L520 Laptop | iMac (Retina 5K, 2017) | Google Nexus 2 |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| DPR | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.5|
| Result |Â ![DPR 1.0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68318893/114030528-d1e7e600-987a-11eb-907f-5734adde0b09.jpeg) | ![DPR 2.0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68318893/114030534-d2807c80-987a-11eb-887b-9f415771bc9e.jpeg) | ![DPR 3.5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68318893/114030537-d3191300-987a-11eb-8b82-012c0251c978.jpeg) |

**Learned:** Initial image loaded corresponds to current screensize. If I have 992 or more px. The one loaded is 1200px wide. 

At a screen width (window.innerWidth) of 412px the following images are loaded:

| Device | Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) | DPR Relative Width in px | Image displayed | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Desktop | 1 | 412 | 576x576.jpg | image xs is wide enought to cover the area. |
| iMac | 2 | 816 | 992x576.jpg | Image xs and sm are to small, but image md covers the area. |
| Google Nexus | 3.5 | 1442 | 1200x576.jpg | Image lg is the largest image available. Its too small, but we can't be picky here. |
