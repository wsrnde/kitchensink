## srcset Usage 
The browser has no knowlege about the dimensions of an image before it downloaded it from its source.

The srcset attribute offers the browser a list of images and also tells it what width each one of the is supposed to have.

Depending on the current screen width and the DPR (Device Pixel Ratio), the browser will pick one of theses images and download it. All other pictures are ignored  If the screen size is later changed, it will reconsider its decision.

**2do** Check what happens if this image cannot be downloaded

### DPR?
The Device Pixel Ratio is a measure of how many pixels a screen will fit into a CSS pixel (in one direction). The exact number depends on the screen:

* many desktop devices have a DPR of 1, 
* apple iMacs a device ratio of 2, and 
* the majority of mobile devices have a DPR of 2 or higher (google nexus has a DPR of 3.5).

### Example 1:
This image has no default (src is empty). scrset lists 4 different images

```
<img 
     src=""
     srcset="uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/1200x576.png 1200w,
             uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/992x576.png   992w,
             uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/768x576.png   768w,
             uploads/2736/bilder/srcset/576x576.png   576w"
     alt="srcset Test"
>
```

For this example the screen width on all devices is reduced to 412px. 


| Device | Thinkpad L520 Laptop | iMac (Retina 5K, 2017) | Google Nexus 2 |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| DPR | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.5|
| Screen width | 412px | 412px | 412px |
| DPR relative width | 412px | 816px | 1442px |

| Notes | image xs is wide enought to cover the area | Image xs and sm are to small, but image md covers the area. | Image lg is the largest image available. Its too small, but we can't be picky here. |

**Learned:** Initial image loaded corresponds to current screensize. If I have 992 or more px. The one loaded is 1200px wide.
